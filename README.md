# X-NUCLEO-S2915A1

Arduino library to support the X-NUCLEO-S2915A1 based on S2-LP radio and operates in the 915 MHz ISM frequency band.

## Examples

There is one example with the X-NUCLEO-S2915A1 library.
* X_NUCLEO_S2915A1_HelloWorld: This application provides a simple example of usage of the X-NUCLEO-S2915A1 
Expansion Board. It shows how to send and receive a string between two X-NUCLEO-S2915A1 Expansion Boards each one
connected to a Nucleo board; in order to send the string you just need to push the button of the Nucleo board;
in order to see the received string you just need to open a hyperterminal connected to the Virtual COM port of
the Nucleo board.

## Dependencies
